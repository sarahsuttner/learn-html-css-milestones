    <h1>Basic CSS</h1>
    <h2>CSS styles offer a variety of ways in which you can alter the appearance of your web page</h2>
    <p>This paragraph, for example, is in the font family of Helvetica, and it has a designated line height and color. It also has a padding left parameter of
      100px.The first header, at the top of the page, has a specific font size implemented into it. The
    secondary header, however, has a left margin value and a letter spacing quality.</p>
    <h3 class = "redtext">This is text that is defined by a class selector.</h3>
    <h4 id = "yellowtext">This is text that is defined by an id selector.</h4>

    <div>
      <p>The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element. This is an example of one specified with a pink background.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element. This is an example of one specified with a pink background.</p>

  </body>
